  "response": "I'm glad to hear that you've mastered mathematics topics in Grade 4. The question you're asking about is a subtraction problem:\n\n428 - 176\n\nTo solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Start with the number 428.\n2. Subtract 176 from 428.\n\nWhen you subtract 176 from 428, you get:\n\n252\n\nSo, the answer to the subtraction problem is:\n\n**252**\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect, so keep practicing your math skills and you'll become more confident in no time!\n\nHere's a little bonus question to help you practice:\n\n**438 - 245 =?**\n\nTake your time, and think carefully about the answer. You can always ask for help if you get stuck!\n\n**438 - 245 = 193**\n\nHow was that? Did I help you feel more confident about math?<|eot_id|>",
