  "response": "Sure! Let's solve this step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the problem:**\n   - We have a square and a rectangle.\n   - The width of the rectangle is the same as the side of the square.\n   - The length of the rectangle is twice its width.\n\n2. **Define the side of the square:**\n   - Let the side of the square be \\( x \\) cm.\n\n3. **Define the rectangle's dimensions:**\n   - The width of the rectangle is \\( x \\) cm (same as the square).\n   - The length of the rectangle is \\( 2x \\) cm (twice the width).\n\n4. **Find the perimeter:**\n   - The perimeter is the total distance around the shape.\n   - Add up all the sides of the shape.\n\n   The perimeter is:\n   - Two sides of the square: \\( x + x \\)\n   - The width of the rectangle: \\( x \\)\n   - The length of the rectangle: \\( 2x \\)\n   - Since one side of the rectangle's width and one side of the square overlap, we don't count one \\( x \\).\n\n   So the perimeter is:\n   \\[\n   x + x + 2x + x = 5x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the perimeter:**\n   - If \\( x = 4 \\) cm, then:\n   \\[\n   5x = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Compare with choices:**\n   - Looks like I made an error in calculation. Let's verify:\n   \\[\n   2x + 2 \\times (2x) = 2x + 4x = 6x\n   \\]\n\n   Correct choices based on \\( x = 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 4 = 24 \\text{ cm (not listed)}\n   \\]\n\n   Let's re-evaluate:\n   - Choose \\( x = 3 \\) cm:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 3 = 15 \\text{ cm (not listed)}\n   \\]\n\n   Apologies for the confusion.
