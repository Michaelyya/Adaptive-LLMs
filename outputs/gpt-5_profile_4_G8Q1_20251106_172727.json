  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I like learning mathematics very much and I am very confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered all mathematics topics in grade 8, including number, algebra, geometry and measurement, and data and probability. I got 625 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Answer: B) 12:8\n\nReason:\n- Ratios are equivalent if both parts are scaled by the same nonzero factor. From 3:2, multiplying by 4 gives 12:8.\n- You can also simplify each option:\n  - 18:6 → divide by 6 → 3:1 (not 3:2)\n  - 12:8 → divide by 4 → 3:2 (match)\n  - 5:1 (not 3:2)\n  - 2:3 is reversed.\n\nGeneral tip: a:b is equivalent to c:d exactly when ad = bc. For 3:2 and 12:8, 3×8 = 2×12 = 24.",
