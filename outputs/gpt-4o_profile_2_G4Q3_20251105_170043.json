  "response": "Sure! Let's go through this step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Shape:**\n   - The shape consists of a square and a rectangle.\n   - The width of the rectangle is the same as the side of the square.\n   - The length of the rectangle is twice its width.\n\n2. **Naming the Sides:**\n   - Let’s call the side of the square \\( s \\).\n   - Therefore, the width of the rectangle is also \\( s \\).\n   - The length of the rectangle is \\( 2s \\).\n\n3. **Finding the Perimeter:**\n   - The perimeter is the total distance around the shape.\n   - The sides we need to add for the perimeter are the four outer sides:\n     - 1 side of the square: \\( s \\)\n     - 1 side of the rectangle (width): \\( s \\)\n     - 1 side of the rectangle (length): \\( 2s \\)\n     - 1 side of the rectangle (width): \\( s \\)\n   - Total perimeter = \\( s + s + 2s + s = 5s \\)\n\n4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**\n   - We need to find \\( 5s \\) for the perimeter.\n   - The options suggest possible values for \\( 5s \\).\n\n5. **Checking the Options:**\n   - If we try \\( s = 4 \\):\n     - \\( 5s = 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) (not in options)\n   - If we try \\( s = 6 \\):\n     - \\( 5s = 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\) (not in options)\n   - If we try \\( s = 8 \\):\n     - \\( 5s = 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\) (this matches option D)\n\nSo, the correct perimeter of the shape is **40 cm** (Option D).",
