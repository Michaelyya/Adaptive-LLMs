  "response": "To solve the problem, we need to factor the expression \\(2y + 6xy^2\\) and match it with one of the given options.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Common Factors:**\n   - Look for the greatest common factor (GCF) in the terms \\(2y\\) and \\(6xy^2\\).\n   - Both terms have the factor \\(2y\\).\n\n2. **Factor Out the GCF:**\n   - Factor \\(2y\\) out of each term:\n     - From \\(2y\\), factoring out \\(2y\\) gives \\(1\\).\n     - From \\(6xy^2\\), factoring out \\(2y\\) gives \\(3xy\\) (since \\(\\frac{6xy^2}{2y} = 3xy\\)).\n\n3. **Write the Factored Expression:**\n   - The expression becomes:\n     \\[\n     2y(1 + 3xy)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Match with the Options:**\n   - The factored expression \\(2y(1 + 3xy)\\) matches option **A**.\n\nTherefore, the expression equivalent to \\(2y + 6xy^2\\) is given by option **A**, which is \\(2y(1 + 3xy)\\).",
