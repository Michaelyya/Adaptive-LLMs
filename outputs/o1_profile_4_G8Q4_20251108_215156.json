Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "A quick way to see why \\(x=60^\\circ\\) is to notice that, despite the “five‐sided” appearance, only four of those corners are actually **interior angles** of the polygon.  The “top” is split into two segments but forms just **one** interior angle there (labeled \\(x\\)).\n\nSince it is effectively a **four‐sided shape** (a quadrilateral) with interior angles \\(100^\\circ,\\;115^\\circ,\\;85^\\circ,\\) and \\(x^\\circ,\\) their sum must be\n\\[\n100^\\circ \\;+\\; 115^\\circ \\;+\\; 85^\\circ \\;+\\; x^\\circ \\;=\\; 360^\\circ.\n\\]\nHence,\n\\[\nx^\\circ \\;=\\;360^\\circ - \\bigl(100^\\circ + 115^\\circ + 85^\\circ\\bigr)\n           \\;=\\;60^\\circ.\n\\]",
