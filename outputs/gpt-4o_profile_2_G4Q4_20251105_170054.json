  "response": "Sure! Let's work through this question together.\n\nCharlie is 24 years old, and he is a certain number of years older than Jenny. We want to find out Jenny's age.\n\nLet's say that the number of years Charlie is older than Jenny is represented by a box, like this: □.\n\nSince Charlie is older, we can find Jenny's age by subtracting the number of years from Charlie's age. So the correct equation would be:\n\n- Jenny's age = Charlie's age - □\n\nThis means we should look for the option that says 24 - □.\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n**A. 24 - □**\n\nDoes that make sense? If you have any questions, feel free to ask!",
