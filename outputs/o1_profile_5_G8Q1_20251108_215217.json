  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and geometry in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Let’s talk about what it means for two ratios to be equivalent.  \n\nA ratio of 3:2 means that for every 3 of something, there are 2 of something else. In decimal form, 3:2 can be seen as 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5.\n\nTo check if another ratio is equivalent, we see if it can be turned into 3:2 by multiplying or dividing both sides by the same number. For example, starting with 3:2:  \n• If you multiply both 3 and 2 by 4, you get 12:8.  \n\nNow let’s test each choice:  \n• A) 18:6 → 18 ÷ 6 = 3 (this is 3:1, not 3:2).  \n• B) 12:8 → 12 ÷ 8 = 1.5 (which matches 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5).  \n• C) 5:1 → 5 ÷ 1 = 5 (not 1.5).  \n• D) 2:3 → 2 ÷ 3 = about 0.67 (not 1.5).  \n\nSo the ratio that’s equivalent to 3:2 is 12:8 (Choice B).
