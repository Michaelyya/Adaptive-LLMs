  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and geometry in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Absolutely—I’m glad you asked. Let’s take it step by step.\n\nIdea you need: The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral (4-sided shape) is 360°. You can remember this because a quadrilateral can be split into 2 triangles, and each triangle has 180°, so 2 × 180° = 360°.\n\nIn the picture, the four interior angles are:\n- 100°\n- 115°\n- 85°\n- x°\n\n1) Add the three known angles:\n100 + 115 + 85 = 300°\n\n2) Subtract from 360° to get the missing angle:\nx = 360 − 300 = 60°\n\nAnswer: x = 60°\n\nWant a quick practice to build confidence? Try this: In another quadrilateral, three angles are 90°, 120°, and 70°. What is the fourth angle? (Use 360 − (90 + 120 + 70).) If you want, tell me your result and I’ll check it!",
