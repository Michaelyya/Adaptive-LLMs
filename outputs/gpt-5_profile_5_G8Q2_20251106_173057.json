  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and geometry in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Yes—let’s do it step by step. You’ve got this.\n\nGoal: Find where 5/12 is on the number line.\n\n1) Compare 5/12 to the marked benchmarks.\n- The line shows 1/4 and 1/2.\n- Rewrite them with denominator 12:\n  - 1/4 = 3/12\n  - 1/2 = 6/12\n- So 5/12 is between 3/12 and 6/12, and it’s only 1/12 less than 6/12. That means it’s just a bit to the left of 1/2 and closer to 1/2 than to 1/4.\n\n2) Use the picture.\n- Points A and B are between 1/4 and 1/2.\n- C and D are to the right of 1/2, so they’re too big.\n- Between A and B, the point closer to 1/2 is B.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nQuick check (optional): 5/12 ≈ 0.4167, which is between 0.25 (1/4) and 0.5 (1/2) and closer to 0.5—matches point B.\n\nWant to try a similar one together next? For example, where would 7/12 be relative to 1/2?",
