  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and geometry in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Let’s first note that the shape in the diagram is a quadrilateral (a four‐sided polygon).  A key fact about quadrilaterals is that the sum of their four interior angles is always 360°.  Three of the angles are given: 100°, 115°, and 85°.  Let x° be the fourth angle.\n\nStep 1: Add the three known angles:  \n100° + 115° + 85° = 300°  \n\nStep 2: Subtract this total from 360° to find x:  \nx = 360° − 300° = 60°  \n\nSo, the value of x is 60°.  \n\nTip: Whenever you see a four‐sided figure (no matter how “tilted” or irregular it looks), remember that its angles sum up to 360°. That’s often your quick way to find a missing angle!",
