  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 4, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and data in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "You can do this! Let’s go step by step.\n\n- Charlie is 24.\n- He is □ years older than Jenny. That means:\n  Charlie’s age = Jenny’s age + □\n\nWe want Jenny’s age. So we undo the “+ □” by subtracting □ from 24:\nJenny’s age = 24 − □\n\nSo the correct choice is: A. 24 − □\n\nWhy not the others?\n- □ + 24 gives Charlie’s age, not Jenny’s.\n- □ − 24 doesn’t match the story.\n- 24 × □ is not about “older than.”\n\nQuick practice: Mia is 13 years old. Sam is 5 years older than Mia. Sam’s age = 13 + 5 = 18. If you know Sam is 18 and he is 5 years older than Mia, then Mia = 18 − 5 = 13. Same idea!\n\nWant a few more like this to try together?",
