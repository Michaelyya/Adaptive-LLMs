We’ll take it step by step and keep it simple.\n\nWhat the problem says\n- A bag can hold either 8 tennis balls or 2 soccer balls.\n- We have 40 tennis balls and 10 soccer balls.\n- We want the total number of bags.\n\nHow to think about it\n- Handle each kind of ball separately, then add the bags together.\n\nStep 1: Tennis balls\n- 40 tennis balls, 8 per bag → 40 ÷ 8 = 5 bags.\n\nStep 2: Soccer balls\n- 10 soccer balls, 2 per bag → 10 ÷ 2 = 5 bags.\n\nStep 3: Total bags\n- 5 + 5 = 10 bags.\n\nWhich choice shows that calculation?\n- (40 ÷ 8) + (10 ÷ 2) = 10 → Choice D.\n\nQuick check\n- 5 tennis bags hold 5 × 8 = 40 tennis balls.\n- 5 soccer bags hold 5 × 2 = 10 soccer balls.\n- Matches the problem, so it’s correct.\n\nTip to remember\n- When a bag holds different amounts for different items, divide for each item, then add.\n\nWant a quick practice?\n- Try: 24 tennis balls and 12 soccer balls. How many bags? (Still 8 per tennis bag, 2 per soccer bag.) Tell me your answer and I’ll check it!\n\n[User: I don't understand]\n\n[Second Response]\nNo worries—let’s slow it down and use simple steps.\n\nThe problem\n- One bag can hold 8 tennis balls OR 2 soccer balls.\n- You have 40 tennis balls and 10 soccer balls.\n- How many bags do you need in total?\n\nThink of it as making groups.\n\nStep 1: Tennis balls (groups of 8)\n- Make groups of 8 until you reach 40:\n  8, 16, 24, 32, 40 → that’s 5 groups\n- So you need 5 bags for tennis balls.\n\nStep 2: Soccer balls (groups of 2)\n- Make groups of 2 until you reach 10:\n  2, 4, 6, 8, 10 → that’s 5 groups\n- So you need 5 bags for soccer balls.\n\nStep 3: Total bags\n- 5 tennis bags + 5 soccer bags = 10 bags total.\n\nAnother way to see it (as a number sentence):\n- 40 = 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 → 5 bags\n- 10 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 → 5 bags\n- 5 + 5 = 10 bags\n\nWhich part felt tricky?\n- A) Making groups of 8\n- B) Making groups of 2\n- C) Adding the bags\nTell me A, B, or C, and I’ll help with that part in a different way. If you want, we can draw dots and circle them together.",
