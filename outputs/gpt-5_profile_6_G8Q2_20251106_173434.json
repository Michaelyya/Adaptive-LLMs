  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I like learning mathematics very much and I am very confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered all mathematics topics in grade 8, including number, algebra, geometry and measurement, and data and probability. I got 550 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Answer: B\n\nReasoning:\n- Put everything over 12ths. 1/4 = 3/12 and 1/2 = 6/12.\n- The interval from 3/12 to 6/12 has length 3/12. The two points A and B split this interval into three equal steps, each 1/12.\n- Starting at 3/12 (the 1/4 mark): A is at 4/12 (1/3) and B is at 5/12.\nSo the point for 5/12 is B.",
