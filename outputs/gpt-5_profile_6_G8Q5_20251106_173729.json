  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I like learning mathematics very much and I am very confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered all mathematics topics in grade 8, including number, algebra, geometry and measurement, and data and probability. I got 550 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Great question. Nancy says: for each month, Zedlander sales > 2 × (Zed Times sales).\n\nCheck any month (a counterexample is enough):\n\n- January: Zed Times ≈ 8,000, so double is ≈ 16,000. Zedlander is only ≈ 10,500 < 16,000.\nThus it’s not more than double in January, so the claim “each month” is false.\n\nYou can see it also fails in Feb and Mar:\n- Feb: Zedlander ≈ 18,000 vs 2 × 11,000 ≈ 22,000.\n- Mar: Zedlander ≈ 17,000 vs 2 × 10,000 = 20,000.\n\nTherefore Nancy’s claim is incorrect.",
