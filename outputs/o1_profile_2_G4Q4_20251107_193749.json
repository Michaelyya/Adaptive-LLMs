  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 4, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and data in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Let’s think step by step:\n\n1. We know Charlie is 24 years old.\n2. We also know Charlie is “▢” (some number) of years older than Jenny.  \n   • This means if Jenny’s age is J, then Charlie’s age = J + ▢.  \n3. Because Charlie is 24, we have: 24 = J + ▢.  \n4. Solving for Jenny’s age (J) gives us:  \n   J = 24 – ▢.  \n\nSo Jenny’s age is 24 – ▢, which matches choice A.\n\nTip to remember:  \nIf someone is older by a certain number of years, you subtract that number from the older person’s age to get the younger person’s age.",
