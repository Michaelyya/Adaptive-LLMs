  "response": "I can help you with this math question. The question is about a square and a rectangle. The width of the rectangle is the same as the width of the square. The length of the rectangle is twice as long as its width. \n\n*   The width of the rectangle is the same as the width of the square.\n*   The length of the rectangle is twice as long as its width.\n\nLet's use \"x\" to represent the width of the square and the width of the rectangle. \n\n*   The length of the rectangle is 2x.\n\nThe width of the square is 28 cm, so the width of the rectangle is 28 cm. The length of the rectangle is 2 x 28 cm = 56 cm. \n\nThe shape is a rectangle with a length of 56 cm and a width of 28 cm. To find the perimeter, we need to add the lengths of all sides. \n\n*   Perimeter = 2 x (length + width)\n*   Perimeter = 2 x (56 + 28)\n*   Perimeter = 2 x 84\n*   Perimeter = 168 cm\n\nThe perimeter of the shape is 168 cm.<|eot_id|>",
