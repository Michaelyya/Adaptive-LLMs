  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I like learning mathematics very much and I am very confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered all mathematics topics in grade 8, including number, algebra, geometry and measurement, and data and probability. I got 550 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "A concise way to see that Nancy’s claim (“the Zedlander was more than double Zed Times every month ”) is incorrect is to compare each month’s bars:\n\n• In January, Zed Times’ sales are about 7000 and the Zedlander’s are about 10 000 to 11 000. Double of 7000 would be 14 000—not 10 000 to 11 000.  \n• In March, Zed Times’ sales are around 8000, so “double” would be 16 000. The Zedlander is around 15 000, which is not more than 16 000.\n\nOnly in February does the Zedlander’s bar (about 18 000) appear to be roughly double Zed Times (about 9000). Because it is not more than double in January or March, Nancy’s claim for “each month” does not hold.",
