Let’s solve it clue by clue together.\n\nGiven table (numbers we already know):\n- Tortoise: Blue 8, Red 4, Yellow 3\n- Giraffe: Blue 3, Red 2, Yellow 10\n- Fish: Blue ?, Red ?, Yellow ?\n\nClue 1: “The same number of blue fish as yellow giraffes.”\n- Yellow giraffes = 10\n- So blue fish = 10\n\nClue 2: “The same number of red fish as the other two red animals combined.”\n- Red tortoises = 4, red giraffes = 2\n- Combined = 4 + 2 = 6\n- So red fish = 6\n\nClue 3: “There are 24 yellow animals in all.”\n- Yellow tortoises 3 + yellow giraffes 10 + yellow fish ? = 24\n- 3 + 10 = 13, so yellow fish = 24 − 13 = 11\n\nFish row completed:\n- Blue fish = 10\n- Red fish = 6\n- Yellow fish = 11\n\nQuick check:\n- Blue fish 10 equals yellow giraffes 10 ✔\n- Red fish 6 equals 4 + 2 ✔\n- Yellow total: 3 + 10 + 11 = 24 ✔\n\nNice work! Want to try a similar one next?\n\n[User: I don't understand]\n\n[Second Response]\nThat’s okay! Let’s slow down and do it together. I’ll restate the problem in simple steps.\n\nWe have animals and colors.
