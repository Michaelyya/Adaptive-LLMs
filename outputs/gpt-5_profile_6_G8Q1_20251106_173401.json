  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I like learning mathematics very much and I am very confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered all mathematics topics in grade 8, including number, algebra, geometry and measurement, and data and probability. I got 550 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Answer: B) 12:8\n\nReason: Ratios are equivalent if both parts are multiplied (or divided) by the same nonzero factor. \n- 3:2 × 4 = 12:8 → equivalent.\nQuick checks for others:\n- 18:6 ÷ 6 = 3:1 (not 3:2)\n- 5:1 is already simplified (not 3:2)\n- 2:3 is reversed.\n\nTip: You can also compare by turning each into a fraction; 3/2 = 1.5, and only 12/8 = 1.5.",
