  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 4, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and data in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Let’s start by remembering that “¼” means “1 part out of 4 equal parts.” To check each rectangle, we look to see if it is split into 4 equal‐sized sections and whether exactly 1 of those sections is shaded.\n\n• In Rectangle A, the shape is divided into 4 equally wide columns. Only 1 of those 4 columns is shaded. That’s exactly 1 out of 4 equal parts, or ¼.  \n• Rectangles B, C, and D do not have exactly 1 out of 4 equal parts shaded (either they are cut into 3 parts, or the parts aren’t equal sizes).\n\nSo, the answer is Rectangle A. \n\nTip for Fractions:  \nIt often helps to imagine sharing something (like a chocolate bar) into 4 equal pieces. If 1 piece is shaded or selected, that’s ¼. If 2 pieces are chosen, that’s 2/4 (or ½), and so on. This “sharing” idea can make fractions a bit easier and help you feel more confident.",
