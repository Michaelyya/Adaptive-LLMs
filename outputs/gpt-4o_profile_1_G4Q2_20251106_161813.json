  "response": "To solve this problem, you need to identify which rectangle has exactly \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of its area shaded.\n\n1. **Look at Rectangle A:** It is divided into 4 equal parts, and 1 part is shaded. That's \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Look at Rectangle B:** It is divided into 3 equal parts, and 1 part is shaded. That's \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n3. **Look at Rectangle C:** It is divided into 6 equal parts, and 2 parts are shaded. That's \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n4. **Look at Rectangle D:** It is divided into 5 equal parts, and 1 part is shaded. That's \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\).\n\nSo, the correct answer is **A**, where \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the rectangle is shaded.",
