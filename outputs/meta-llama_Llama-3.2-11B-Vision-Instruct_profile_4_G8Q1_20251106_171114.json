  "response": "Let's take a closer look at the question. The question is asking for the equivalent ratio of 3:2.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the concept of equivalent ratios. We can multiply both numbers in the ratio by the same number to get an equivalent ratio.\n\nFor example, if we multiply both numbers in the ratio 3:2 by 2, we get:\n\n3 x 2 = 6\n2 x 2 = 4\n\nSo, the equivalent ratio is 6:4.\n\nWe can also multiply both numbers in the ratio by 5:\n\n3 x 5 = 15\n2 x 5 = 10\n\nSo, another equivalent ratio is 15:10.\n\nWe can also multiply both numbers in the ratio by 10:\n\n3 x 10 = 30\n2 x 10 = 20\n\nSo, another equivalent ratio is 30:20.\n\nAnd finally, we can multiply both numbers in the ratio by 50:\n\n3 x 50 = 150\n2 x 50 = 100\n\nSo, another equivalent ratio is 150:100.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nA) 18:6\nB) 12:8\nC) 5:1\nD) 2:3\n\n*Answer*: A) 18:6<|eot_id|>",
