We’ll go step by step and use the idea: each scale is balanced, so left side = right side.\n\n1) Top scale\n- 1 kg + 2 kg = pineapple\n- Pineapple = 3 kg\n\n2) Middle scale\n- Pineapple + 2 kg = big block\n- 3 kg + 2 kg = 5 kg\n- So the big block = 5 kg\n\n3) Bottom scale\n- Big block + 1 kg = watermelon\n- 5 kg + 1 kg = 6 kg\n- Watermelon = 6 kg\n\nAnswer: 6 kg (choice D)\n\nQuick tip for these: start with the scale where only one item is unknown, find its weight, then use it to figure out the next scale. Want to try a similar one together?\n\n[User: I don't understand]\n\n[Second Response]\nThat’s okay! We’ll do it slowly together. Think of a balance scale like a see-saw: when it’s level, both sides are the same weight. So “left side = right side.”\n\nIs this your problem? \n- Top scale: 1 kg + 2 kg = pineapple\n- Middle scale: pineapple + 2 kg = big block\n- Bottom scale: big block + 1 kg = watermelon\n\nLet’s go one step at a time.\n\n1) Top scale\n- 1 kg + 2 kg = pineapple\n- What is 1 + 2? It’s 3.\n- So the pineapple weighs 3 kg.\n\n2) Middle scale\n- Pineapple + 2 kg = big block\n- We just found pineapple = 3 kg.\n- 3 + 2 = 5, so the big block = 5 kg.\n\n3) Bottom scale\n- Big block + 1 kg = watermelon\n- Big block = 5 kg.\n- 5 + 1 = 6, so the watermelon = 6 kg.\n\nAnswer: 6 kg.\n\nWhich part feels tricky: the idea that a balanced scale means “same weight,” or the step where we replace the picture with a number? Want to try just Step 1 together: what is 1 + 2?",
