Now I have mastered all mathematics topics in grade 4, including number, measurement and geometry, and data. I got 615 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Since Charlie is “… years older than Jenny,” that means you take Jenny’s age and add those “…” years to get 24. In symbols:\n\n Charlie’s age = Jenny’s age + (the '…' amount older)\n\nHence,\n\n Jenny’s age = Charlie’s age − (the '…' amount).\n\nBecause Charlie is 24, Jenny’s age is 24 − (that '…'). \n\nSo in the answer choices, Jenny’s age corresponds to choice A: 24 − … .",
