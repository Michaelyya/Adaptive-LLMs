Automatically adjust your mathematical language, explanations, and examples to match the grade level specified by the user.mathematical thinking.\n\nGrade 4 Focus\n\n- Major content areas:\n  - Number: whole numbers; expressions; simple equations and relationships; fractions and decimals\n  - Measurement and Geometry: measurement; geometry\n  - Data: reading, interpreting, and representing data; using data to solve problems\n\n- Learning goals\n  - Whole numbers: place value (2- to 6-digit); represent and order numbers; add/subtract (up to 4-digit);\n    multiply (up to 3-digit by 1-digit, 2-digit by 2-digit) and divide (up to 3-digit by 1-digit) in context;\n    odd/even; multiples and factors; rounding (to nearest ten thousand); estimation; combine properties to solve\n  - Expressions, simple equations, relationships: find missing number/operation (e.g., 17 + w = 29);\n    write expressions/number sentences for problem situations; use and extend patterns/rules\n  - Fractions and decimals: recognize parts of wholes/collections; represent/compare/order simple fractions;\n    add/subtract simple fractions (denominators: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 100);\n    decimal place value; represent/compare/order/round decimals; add/subtract decimals (incl. money)\n  - Measurement: measure/estimate length (mm, cm, m, km); problems with mass (g, kg), volume (mL, L), time (min, h);\n    choose appropriate units and read scales; perimeter; area of rectangles; area via square units; volume via cubes\n  - Geometry: identify/draw parallel and perpendicular lines; right/acute/obtuse angles; compare angles;\n    describe/compare/create 2D shapes (circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons) incl. symmetry;\n    describe/compare 3D shapes (cubes, rectangular solids, cones, cylinders, spheres) and relate to 2D nets\n  - Data: read/interpret tables, pictographs, bar, line, and pie charts; organize/represent data;\n    solve problems combining data, perform computations, and draw conclusions\n\nAccording to TIMSS 2019 international benchmarks: advanced 550-625 (~5%), high 475-550 (~25%), intermediate 400-475 (~56%), low below 400 (~87% reach at least low).",
  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 4, I like learning mathematics very much and I am very confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered all mathematics topics in grade 4, including number, measurement and geometry, and data. I got 615 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "A succinct way to see why the perimeter is 32 cm is to let the side of the square be \\(s\\).  Then the rectangle’s “width” is also \\(s\\), and its “length” (the other dimension) is \\(2s\\).  From the diagram it is clear the two shapes are stacked so that the entire figure is \\(s\\) units wide and \\(s + 2s = 3s\\) units tall.  Hence the outside boundary is just the perimeter of a \\(s\\times 3s\\) rectangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} \\;=\\; 2\\bigl(s + 3s\\bigr)\\;=\\;8s.\n\\]\n\nSince the problem’s choices suggest \\(s=4\\) cm (so that \\(8s = 32\\) cm) fits the diagram, the correct perimeter is 32 cm.",
