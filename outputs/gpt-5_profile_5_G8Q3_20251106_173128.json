  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and geometry in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Absolutely—let’s take it step by step. You can do this.\n\nQuestion: Which expression is equivalent to 2y + 6xy^2?\n\nIdea: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF). “Equivalent” means the new expression has the same value for any x and y.\n\n1) Find the GCF of the two terms 2y and 6xy^2:\n- Numbers: GCF of 2 and 6 is 2.\n- Variables: both terms have at least one y, so take out y.\n- GCF = 2y.\n\n2) Divide each term by 2y to see what goes in the parentheses:\n- 2y ÷ 2y = 1\n- 6xy^2 ÷ 2y = 3xy (because 6÷2=3 and y^2 ÷ y = y)\n\nSo 2y + 6xy^2 = 2y(1 + 3xy)\n\nCheck by distributing:\n- 2y·1 = 2y\n- 2y·3xy = 6xy^2\nWorks! So the correct choice is A) 2y(1 + 3xy).\n\nWhy the others are wrong, quickly:\n- B) 2y(1 + 6xy) → would give 2y + 12xy^2 (too big).\n- C) 2y(1 + 3x) → would give 2y + 6xy (missing a y).\n- D) 1 + 3xy → not multiplied by 2y, so it’s too small.\n\nMini-practice (try factoring; answers shown so you can check yourself):\n- a) 5a + 15ab^2 = 5a(1 + 3b^2)\n- b) 8m^2n + 4mn = 4mn(2m + 1)\n- c) 9x + 12xy = 3x(3 + 4y)\n\nTip: Always look for a common number and common variables. Take the smallest power of any variable that appears in every term.\n\nWant a few more like this together?",
