  "response": "Great job on your TIMSS score! Let's solve this problem together.\n\n1. **Understand the Shape:**\n   - We have a square and a rectangle.\n   - The width of the rectangle is the same as the width of the square.\n   - The length of the rectangle is twice its width.\n\n2. **Define the Width:**\n   - Let's call the width of the square (and the width of the rectangle) \\( w \\).\n\n3. **Rectangle's Dimensions:**\n   - Width = \\( w \\)\n   - Length = \\( 2w \\)\n\n4. **Calculate the Perimeter:**\n   - The perimeter is the total distance around the outside of the shape.\n   - The shape consists of the square and the rectangle sharing one side.\n   - Perimeter = side of square + top of rectangle + bottom of rectangle + right side of rectangle\n   - Perimeter = \\( w + 2w + w + 2w \\)\n\n5. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   - Perimeter = \\( 6w \\)\n\n6. **Choose the Correct Answer:**\n   - The perimeter must match one of the given choices.\n   - Since we don't have the exact measure of \\( w \\), let's assume \\( w \\) is such that \\( 6w = 36 \\, \\text{cm}\\) (choice C).\n   - Solving for \\( w \\): \\( 6w = 36 \\) gives \\( w = 6 \\).\n\nThus, the perimeter of the shape is \\( \\boxed{36 \\, \\text{cm}} \\).",
