  "response": "Sure, let's work through this together!\n\nWe need to find which expression is equivalent to \\(2y + 6xy^2\\).\n\n### Step 1: Factor out the greatest common factor (GCF)\n\nLook at both terms in \\(2y + 6xy^2\\):\n\n- The GCF of \\(2y\\) and \\(6xy^2\\) is \\(2y\\).\n\n### Step 2: Factor out \\(2y\\)\n\nIf we factor \\(2y\\) out of each term:\n\n- From \\(2y\\), we get \\(1\\).\n- From \\(6xy^2\\), we divide by \\(2y\\) to get \\(3xy\\).\n\nSo, \\(2y + 6xy^2\\) can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ \n2y(1 + 3xy)\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe equivalent expression is \\(\\boxed{A}\\) \\(2y(1 + 3xy)\\).\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
