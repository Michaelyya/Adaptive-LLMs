You can do this!\n\nWords to know\n- Side: one edge of the shape.\n- Perimeter: the distance all the way around a shape (add all the side lengths).\n- Equal in length: sides have the same number.\n\nLook at the labels on the sides.\n\n1) “5 sides”\n- Shape A: has 5 sides.\n- Shape B: has 5 sides.\nAnswer: Both shapes (C)\n\n2) “all sides equal in length”\n- Shape A: side lengths are 3, 4, 4, 2, 2 (not all the same).\n- Shape B: all five sides are 3 (all the same).\nAnswer: Shape B (B)\n\n3) “perimeter of 15”\n- Shape A: 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 15\n- Shape B: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 5 × 3 = 15\nAnswer: Both shapes (C)\n\nFinal choices\n- 5 sides: C\n- all sides equal in length: B\n- perimeter of 15: C\n\nQuick tip: For perimeter, list the side lengths and add. If all sides match, multiply one side by the number of sides. Want to try a similar one next?\n\n[User: I don't understand]\n\n[Second Response]\nThat’s okay! We’ll slow it down and do it together. You can do this.\n\nFirst, here are the shape facts we’re using:\n- Shape A has side lengths: 3, 4, 4, 2, 2\n- Shape B has side lengths: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3\n\nWhat the words mean\n- Side: a straight edge of the shape.\n- All sides equal: every side has the same number.\n- Perimeter: add all the side lengths to get the total around the shape.\n\nStep 1: Count sides\n- A has 5 numbers → 5 sides.\n- B has 5 numbers → 5 sides.\nSo “5 sides” is true for both A and B.\n\nStep 2: All sides equal?\n- A: 3, 4, 4, 2, 2 → not all the same.\n- B: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 → all the same.\nSo “all sides equal” is true for B only.\n\nStep 3: Perimeter 15?\n- A: 3 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2\n  Try grouping: (3 + 2) = 5, (4 + 4) = 8, and 5 + 8 + 2 = 15\n- B: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15\nSo “perimeter of 15” is true for both A and B.\n\nYour answers:\n- 5 sides: both shapes (A and B)\n- all sides equal: B\n- perimeter of 15: both shapes (A and B)\n\nWant to practice with one more?\n- New shape C has sides: 2, 2, 2, 2\n  1) How many sides?\n  2) Are all sides equal?\n  3) What is the perimeter?\n\nTell me which part is still confusing: counting sides, “all equal,” or adding for perimeter. I’ll explain that part in a different way.",
