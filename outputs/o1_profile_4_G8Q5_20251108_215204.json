  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I like learning mathematics very much and I am very confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered all mathematics topics in grade 8, including number, algebra, geometry and measurement, and data and probability. I got 625 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "A concise way to see why Nancy’s statement is off is to compare the actual figures month by month.  \n• In January, Zed Times is about 6000 and The Zedlander is about 10 000, which is not twice 6000 (twice 6000 would be 12 000),  \n• In February, The Zedlander is indeed about twice Zed Times,  \n• In March, Zed Times is about 8000 and The Zedlander is about 15 000 (less than double 8000, which would be 16 000).  \n\nBecause it is not “more than double” in two of the three months, Nancy’s claim is incorrect.",
