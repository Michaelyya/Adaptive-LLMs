  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I like learning mathematics very much and I am very confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered all mathematics topics in grade 8, including number, algebra, geometry and measurement, and data and probability. I got 550 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "If two ratios are equivalent, their fractions must simplify to the same value. For example, the ratio 3:2 can be written as the fraction 3/2. Now check each choice:\n\nA) 18:6 → 18 ÷ 6 = 3, which corresponds to 3:1, not 3:2.  \nB) 12:8 → 12 ÷ 8 = 3/2, which matches 3:2.  \nC) 5:1 → 5 ÷ 1 = 5, not 3/2.  \nD) 2:3 → 2 ÷ 3, which is 2/3, not 3/2.  \n\nTherefore, the ratio equivalent to 3:2 is 12:8 (choice B).",
