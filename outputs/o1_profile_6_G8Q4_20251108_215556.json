Now I have mastered all mathematics topics in grade 8, including number, algebra, geometry and measurement, and data and probability. I got 550 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "A succinct way to see why \\(x = 140^\\circ\\) is to use the fact that any pentagon’s interior angles sum to \\(540^\\circ\\).  From the diagram, four of the interior angles are\n\\[\n100^\\circ,\\; 115^\\circ,\\; 85^\\circ,\\;\\text{and another }100^\\circ,\n\\]\nand the fifth angle is \\(x^\\circ.\\)\n\nSo we set up the equation\n\\[\n(100) + (115) + (85) + (100) + x \\;=\\; 540.\n\\]\nAdding the known angles gives \\(400\\), so\n\\[\n400 + x \\;=\\; 540\n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\nx \\;=\\; 140^\\circ.\n\\]",
