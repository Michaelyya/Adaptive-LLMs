  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and geometry in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Great job asking for help. We’ll do this step by step.\n\nGoal: Check if The Zedlander had more than double the sales of Zed Times in each month.\n“More than double” means Zedlander > 2 × (Zed Times).\n\nFrom the graph (approximate values):\n- January: Zed Times ≈ 8,000; Zedlander ≈ 10,500\n- February: Zed Times ≈ 10,500; Zedlander ≈ 18,500\n- March: Zed Times ≈ 10,000; Zedlander ≈ 17,500\n\nDouble the Zed Times and compare:\n- January: 2 × 8,000 = 16,000; Zedlander 10,500 < 16,000\n- February: 2 × 10,500 = 21,000; Zedlander 18,500 < 21,000\n- March: 2 × 10,000 = 20,000; Zedlander 17,500 < 20,000\n\nIn every month, The Zedlander is less than double the Zed Times. So Nancy’s claim is incorrect.\n\nTip: The y‑axis starts at 6,000 (not 0), which makes the bars look more different than they are. Always check the numbers, not just the bar heights.\n\nWant to try a quick check? In which month was The Zedlander closest to double the Zed Times? (It’s February, about 1.8 times.)",
