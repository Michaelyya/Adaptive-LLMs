  "response": "Of course! Let's subtract 176 from 428 step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Line Up the Numbers\n```\n  428\n- 176\n```\n\n### Step 2: Subtract the Ones Place\n- The ones digit in 428 is 8, and in 176 it is 6.\n- Subtract 6 from 8: \\(8 - 6 = 2\\).\n\n### Step 3: Subtract the Tens Place\n- The tens digit in 428 is 2, and in 176 it is 7.\n- Since 2 is less than 7, we need to borrow from the hundreds place.\n- Change the 4 in the hundreds place to 3, and add 10 to the tens place: 12.\n- Now subtract 7 from 12: \\(12 - 7 = 5\\).\n\n### Step 4: Subtract the Hundreds Place\n- The hundreds digit is now 3 (after borrowing), and in 176 it is 1.\n- Subtract 1 from 3: \\(3 - 1 = 2\\).\n\n### Final Answer\n- So, 428 - 176 = 252.\n\nThe answer is 252.",
