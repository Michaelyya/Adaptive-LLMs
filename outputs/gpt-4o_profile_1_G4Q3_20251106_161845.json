  "response": "Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Parts:**\n   - The shape consists of a square and a rectangle.\n   - Let's call the side of the square \\( s \\).\n   - The width of the rectangle is the same as the side of the square, so it's also \\( s \\).\n   - The length of the rectangle is twice its width, so it's \\( 2s \\).\n\n2. **Perimeter of the Shape:**\n   - The perimeter is the total distance around the shape.\n   - The perimeter of the shape includes:\n     - One side of the square: \\( s \\)\n     - Two sides of the rectangle: \\( s + 2s = 3s \\)\n     - The remaining two sides of the square: \\( s + s = 2s \\)\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Perimeter:**\n   - Add all these lengths together:\n     \\[\n     s + 3s + 2s = 6s\n     \\]\n\n4. **Find the Correct Perimeter from the Options:**\n   - Since the options are numerical answers, let's assume \\( s = 4 \\) (you can choose any number, but it should satisfy one of the options):\n     \\[\n     6s = 6 \\times 4 = 24\n     \\]\n\nIt seems I made a mistake, so let's check again:\n\n- The sides we calculated were correct, but we need to double-check the perimeter calculation.\n\n5. **Recalculate the Perimeter:**\n   - The sides to count are:\n     - Square: two sides \\( s + s = 2s \\)\n     - Rectangle: two sides \\( 2s + s = 3s \\)\n   - Combine: \\( 2s + 3s = 5s \\)\n\n6. **Try Again:**\n   - Assume \\( s = 4 \\) (so \\( 5s = 20 \\)). But let's try \\( s = 5 \\).\n     \\[\n     5s = 5 \\times 5 = 25\n     \\]\n\nThe correct calculation shows \\( s = 4 \\) is wrong, let's try \\( s = 6 \\).\n\n7. **Final Perimeter:**\n   - If \\( s = 6 \\), \\( 5s = 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\).\n\nWe need to ensure we count each side correctly and sum properly.
