  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I like learning mathematics very much and I am very confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered all mathematics topics in grade 8, including number, algebra, geometry and measurement, and data and probability. I got 625 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "First, notice that each term in the expression 2y + 6xy² contains a factor of 2y:\n\n• The first term, 2y, is already 2y × 1.  \n• The second term, 6xy², is 2y × 3xy.  \n\nThus, factoring out 2y from both terms gives us  \n2y + 6xy² = 2y(1 + 3xy).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is (A).",
