  "response": "Sure! Let's solve this step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - The shape is made of a square and a rectangle.\n   - The width of the rectangle is the same as the side of the square.\n   - The length of the rectangle is twice as long as its width.\n\n2. **Let's Use a Variable:**\n   - Let the side of the square be \\( x \\).\n   - So, the width of the rectangle is also \\( x \\).\n   - The length of the rectangle is \\( 2x \\).\n\n3. **Find the Perimeter:**\n   - The perimeter of the shape includes:\n     - 2 sides of the square: \\( x + x = 2x \\)\n     - 2 widths of the rectangle: \\( x + x = 2x \\)\n     - 1 length of the rectangle: \\( 2x \\)\n\n4. **Add Them Up:**\n   - Perimeter = \\( 2x + 2x + 2x = 6x \\)\n\n5. **Substitute the Value:**\n   - We need to determine the value of \\( x \\) from the choices given.\n   - Since the perimeter must match one of the options, let's assume \\( x = 4 \\):\n     - Then the perimeter would be \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\), which is not an option.\n   - Let's try \\( x = 5 \\):\n     - Then the perimeter would be \\( 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\), which is not an option.\n   - Let's try \\( x = 6 \\):\n     - Then the perimeter would be \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\), which matches option C.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the shape is **36 cm**, which is option C.",
