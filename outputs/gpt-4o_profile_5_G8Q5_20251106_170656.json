The Zedlander had 10,000 sales, which is less than double.\n\n**February:**\n- Zed Times: about 8,000 sales\n- The Zedlander: about 18,000 sales\n\nDouble of Zed Times for February would be 16,000. The Zedlander had 18,000 sales, which is more than double.\n\n**March:**\n- Zed Times: about 6,000 sales\n- The Zedlander: about 14,000 sales\n\nDouble of Zed Times for March would be 12,000. The Zedlander had 14,000 sales, which is more than double.\n\nNancy’s claim is incorrect because in January, The Zedlander sales were not more than double the Zed Times sales.",
