  "response": "Let's solve this step by step! We need to find which expression is equivalent to \\(2y + 6xy^2\\).\n\nFirst, notice that both terms in the expression \\(2y + 6xy^2\\) have a common factor. Let's factor out the greatest common factor (GCF).\n\n1. **Identify the GCF**: \n   - The first term is \\(2y\\).\n   - The second term is \\(6xy^2\\).\n   - Both terms have a factor of \\(2y\\).\n\n2. **Factor out \\(2y\\)**:\n   - \\(2y + 6xy^2 = 2y(1) + 2y(3xy)\\).\n\n3. **Write it in factored form**:\n   - \\(2y(1 + 3xy)\\).\n\nNow, let's compare this with the options given:\n\n- **A:** \\(2y(1 + 3xy)\\) – This matches what we found.\n- **B:** \\(2y(1 + 6xy)\\) – This doesn't match.\n- **C:** \\(2y(1 + 3x)\\) – This doesn't match.\n- **D:** \\(1 + 3xy\\) – This doesn't match.\n\nThe correct answer is **A: \\(2y(1 + 3xy)\\)**.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further explanation, feel free to ask!",
