  "response": "Sure! Let's work on this subtraction problem together: \\(428 - 176\\).\n\nHere's how you can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Write the numbers in column form**:\n   ```\n     428\n   - 176\n   ```\n\n2. **Subtract the ones place**:\n   - Look at the digits in the ones place: 8 and 6.\n   - Subtract 6 from 8, which is 2.\n\n3. **Subtract the tens place**:\n   - Look at the digits in the tens place: 2 and 7.\n   - Since 2 is less than 7, we need to borrow from the hundreds place.\n   - Borrow 1 from the 4 (making it 3), and add 10 to the 2, making it 12.\n   - Subtract 7 from 12, which is 5.\n\n4. **Subtract the hundreds place**:\n   - Now look at the hundreds: 3 and 1.\n   - Subtract 1 from 3, which is 2.\n\nSo, the answer is 252.\n\nIf you follow these steps, you'll get the correct answer: **252**. Keep practicing, and you'll get even better at it!",
