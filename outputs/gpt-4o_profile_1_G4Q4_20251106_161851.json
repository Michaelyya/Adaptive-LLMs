  "response": "Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.\n\nCharlie is 24 years old and he is a certain number of years older than Jenny. We want to find out Jenny's age.\n\n1. **Understand the relationship**: \n   - If Charlie is 24 years old and is some number of years older than Jenny, then Jenny's age is Charlie's age minus that number.\n\n2. **Set up the equation**:\n   - Let the number of years Charlie is older than Jenny be represented by the black square (let's call it \"x\").\n   - Jenny's age would then be: \\( 24 - x \\).\n\n3. **Choose the correct option**:\n   - The expression that represents Jenny's age is option A: \\( 24 - \\text{black square} \\).\n\nSo, Jenny's age is represented by option A, where you subtract the black square (the number of years Charlie is older than Jenny) from 24.",
