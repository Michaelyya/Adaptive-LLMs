  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 8, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and geometry in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "Let’s break this down step by step. Nancy says, “The Zedlander’s sales are more than double the Zed Times’ sales each month.” To see if that’s true, we can check each month on the graph:\n\n1. Identify the number of sales for each paper.  \n   • In January, Zed Times sells around 7,000–8,000 copies, and The Zedlander sells about 10,000–11,000 copies.  \n   • In February, Zed Times sells around 10,000–11,000 copies, and The Zedlander sells about 18,000–19,000 copies.  \n   • In March, Zed Times sells around 8,000–9,000 copies, and The Zedlander sells about 15,000–16,000 copies.\n\n2. Check what “double” means.  \n   • “Double” means 2 times as much. So, for instance, if Zed Times sells 8,000 copies, doubling it would be 2 × 8,000 = 16,000.\n\n3. Compare The Zedlander’s sales to “double” the Zed Times’ sales.  \n   • January: Double of Zed Times (~7,000–8,000) would be about 14,000–16,000. The Zedlander is only around 10,000–11,000, which is less than 14,000. So it’s not more than double.  \n   • February: Double of Zed Times (~10,000–11,000) would be about 20,000–22,000. The Zedlander is about 18,000–19,000, which is still less than double.  \n   • March: Double of Zed Times (~8,000–9,000) would be about 16,000–18,000. The Zedlander is roughly 15,000–16,000, which might be close but is not clearly above double.\n\nBecause The Zedlander’s sales are never twice as large as Zed Times in any month, Nancy’s claim that they are “more than double” is incorrect.  \n\nHelpful Tip: When someone claims something is “double” something else, multiply the smaller amount by 2 and compare it to see if it truly reaches (or goes beyond) that doubled number.",
