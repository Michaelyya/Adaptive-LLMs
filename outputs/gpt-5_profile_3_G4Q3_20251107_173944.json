  "response": "Great! Let’s solve it together.\n\nStep 1: Name the common width.\n- Let the side of the square be w cm.\n- The rectangle has the same width w and its length is 2w.\n\nStep 2: Walk around the outline and add the sides.\nStarting at the bottom-left corner and going around the shape:\n- Bottom side: w + 2w = 3w\n- Right side (tall): 2w\n- Top side (of the tall rectangle): 2w\n- Down the inside step: w\n- Left along the top of the square: w\n- Down the left side of the square: w\n\nPerimeter P = 3w + 2w + 2w + w + w + w = 10w.\n\nIf the dashed mark represents the common width w = 4 cm (typical for this problem), then\nP = 10 × 4 = 40 cm.\n\nAnswer: 40 cm (choice D). \n\nIf a different width is given, just multiply that number by 10.",
