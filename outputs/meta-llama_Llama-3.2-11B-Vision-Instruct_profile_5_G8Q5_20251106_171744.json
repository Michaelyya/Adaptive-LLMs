  "response": "I understand that you're feeling a bit uncertain about math, but I'm here to help you feel more confident and comfortable with it. Let's take a look at the question you provided and break it down step by step.\n\n**The Question:**\n\nThe graph shows the sales of two Zedland newspapers over three months. The question is: \"Nancy claimed that sales for the Zedlander were more than double the sales for Zed Times each month. Explain why Nancy's claim is incorrect.\"\n\n**Let's Break it Down:**\n\nThe graph shows the sales of two newspapers, Zed Times and The Zedlander, over three months: January, February, and March. The sales are represented by the height of the bars.\n\n*   **January:** Zed Times has a sales of 6,000, while The Zedlander has a sales of 10,000. This means that The Zedlander's sales are more than double Zed Times' sales.\n*   **February:** Zed Times has a sales of 10,000, while The Zedlander has a sales of 18,000. Again, The Zedlander's sales are more than double Zed Times' sales.\n*   **March:** Zed Times has a sales of 10,000, while The Zedlander has a sales of 18,000. Once again, The Zedlander's sales are more than double Zed Times' sales.\n\n**What's the Problem?**\n\nNancy claimed that the sales for The Zedlander were more than double the sales for Zed Times each month. However, according to the graph, this is not true. In all three months, The Zedlander's sales are more than double Zed Times' sales.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNancy's claim is incorrect because The Zedlander's sales are not more than double Zed Times' sales in any of the three months. In fact, The Zedlander's sales are more than double Zed Times' sales in all three months.\n\n**Practice Makes Perfect:**\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect. Keep practicing math problems, and you'll become more confident and comfortable with it. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it, and don't be too hard on yourself if you make mistakes. You got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test, which is a great score. Keep up the good work, and you'll be a math whiz in no time!\n\n**",
