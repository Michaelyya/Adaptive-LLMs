  "response": "Sure! Let's work through this together.\n\nThe shape in the image is a quadrilateral, which means it has four sides. The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\nWe are given three of the angles:\n- \\(100^\\circ\\)\n- \\(115^\\circ\\)\n- \\(85^\\circ\\)\n\nWe need to find the missing angle, \\(x\\).\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we can add up the given angles and subtract the sum from \\(360^\\circ\\):\n\n1. Add the given angles:\n   \\[\n   100^\\circ + 115^\\circ + 85^\\circ = 300^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract this sum from \\(360^\\circ\\) to find \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = 360^\\circ - 300^\\circ = 60^\\circ\n   \\]\n\nSo, the value of \\(x\\) is \\(60^\\circ\\).",
