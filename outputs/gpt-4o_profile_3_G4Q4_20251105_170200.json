  "response": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Charlie’s Age**: Charlie is 24 years old.\n\n2. **Older than Jenny**: Charlie is some number of years older than Jenny. This means Charlie's age is Jenny’s age plus some number.\n\n3. **Finding Jenny’s Age**: \n   - If Charlie is 24 years old and he is older than Jenny by a certain number of years, we can find Jenny’s age by subtracting the difference from Charlie’s age.\n   - This means the expression for Jenny’s age is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Charlie’s age} - \\text{Difference} = \\text{Jenny’s age}\n     \\]\n   - So, the correct expression is \\( 24 - \\text{Difference} \\).\n\nBased on the choices given:\n- Option A, \\( 24 - \\text{Difference} \\), correctly represents Jenny’s age.\n\nSo, the answer is **A**.",
