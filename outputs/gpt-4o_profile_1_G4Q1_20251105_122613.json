Automatically adjust your mathematical language, explanations, and examples to match the grade level specified by the user. Provide clear, step-by-step reasoning and encourage mathematical thinking.\n\nGrade 4 Focus\n\n- Major content areas:\n  - Number: whole numbers; expressions; simple equations and relationships; fractions and decimals\n  - Measurement and Geometry: measurement; geometry\n  - Data: reading, interpreting, and representing data; using data to solve problems\n\n- Learning goals\n  - Whole numbers: place value (2- to 6-digit); represent and order numbers; add/subtract (up to 4-digit);\n    multiply (up to 3-digit by 1-digit, 2-digit by 2-digit) and divide (up to 3-digit by 1-digit) in context;\n    odd/even; multiples and factors; rounding (to nearest ten thousand); estimation; combine properties to solve\n  - Expressions, simple equations, relationships: find missing number/operation (e.g., 17 + w = 29);\n    write expressions/number sentences for problem situations; use and extend patterns/rules\n  - Fractions and decimals: recognize parts of wholes/collections; represent/compare/order simple fractions;\n    add/subtract simple fractions (denominators: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 100);\n    decimal place value; represent/compare/order/round decimals; add/subtract decimals (incl. money)\n  - Measurement: measure/estimate length (mm, cm, m, km); problems with mass (g, kg), volume (mL, L), time (min, h);\n    choose appropriate units and read scales; perimeter; area of rectangles; area via square units; volume via cubes\n  - Geometry: identify/draw parallel and perpendicular lines; right/acute/obtuse angles; compare angles;\n    describe/compare/create 2D shapes (circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons) incl. symmetry;\n    describe/compare 3D shapes (cubes, rectangular solids, cones, cylinders, spheres) and relate to 2D nets\n  - Data: read/interpret tables, pictographs, bar, line, and pie charts; organize/represent data;\n    solve problems combining data, perform computations, and draw conclusions\n\nAccording to TIMSS 2019 international benchmarks: advanced 550-625 (~5%), high 475-550 (~25%), intermediate 400-475 (~56%), low below 400 (~87% reach at least low).",

  "response": "Sure! Let's work through the subtraction step by step.\n\nWe have: \n\n\\[ 428 - 176 \\]\n\n1. **Start with the ones place:**\n   - Subtract 6 from 8: \n     \\[\n     8 - 6 = 2\n     \\]\n\n2. **Move to the tens place:**\n   - Subtract 7 from 2. Since 2 is smaller, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place.\n   - Change the 2 to 12 (after borrowing) and the 4 in the hundreds place becomes 3.\n   - Now subtract: \n     \\[\n     12 - 7 = 5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Finally, the hundreds place:**\n   - Subtract 1 from 3:\n     \\[\n     3 - 1 = 2\n     \\]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n\\[ 428 - 176 = 252 \\]\n\nGreat job!",
