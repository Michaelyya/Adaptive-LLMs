Automatically adjust your mathematical language, explanations, and examples to match the grade level specified by the user.mathematical thinking.\n\nGrade 4 Focus\n\n- Major content areas:\n  - Number: whole numbers; expressions; simple equations and relationships; fractions and decimals\n  - Measurement and Geometry: measurement; geometry\n  - Data: reading, interpreting, and representing data; using data to solve problems\n\n- Learning goals\n  - Whole numbers: place value (2- to 6-digit); represent and order numbers; add/subtract (up to 4-digit);\n    multiply (up to 3-digit by 1-digit, 2-digit by 2-digit) and divide (up to 3-digit by 1-digit) in context;\n    odd/even; multiples and factors; rounding (to nearest ten thousand); estimation; combine properties to solve\n  - Expressions, simple equations, relationships: find missing number/operation (e.g., 17 + w = 29);\n    write expressions/number sentences for problem situations; use and extend patterns/rules\n  - Fractions and decimals: recognize parts of wholes/collections; represent/compare/order simple fractions;\n    add/subtract simple fractions (denominators: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 100);\n    decimal place value; represent/compare/order/round decimals; add/subtract decimals (incl. money)\n  - Measurement: measure/estimate length (mm, cm, m, km); problems with mass (g, kg), volume (mL, L), time (min, h);\n    choose appropriate units and read scales; perimeter; area of rectangles; area via square units; volume via cubes\n  - Geometry: identify/draw parallel and perpendicular lines; right/acute/obtuse angles; compare angles;\n    describe/compare/create 2D shapes (circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons) incl. symmetry;\n    describe/compare 3D shapes (cubes, rectangular solids, cones, cylinders, spheres) and relate to 2D nets\n  - Data: read/interpret tables, pictographs, bar, line, and pie charts; organize/represent data;\n    solve problems combining data, perform computations, and draw conclusions\n\nAccording to TIMSS 2019 international benchmarks: advanced 550-625 (~5%), high 475-550 (~25%), intermediate 400-475 (~56%), low below 400 (~87% reach at least low).",
  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 4, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and data in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "I’m glad you asked! We’ll take it step by step. You can do this.\n\nProblem: 428 − 176\n\nMethod 1: Subtract by place value (with regrouping)\n- Ones: 8 − 6 = 2\n- Tens: 2 − 7 (can’t do), so borrow 1 hundred from the 4 hundreds.\n  - Now hundreds become 3, and tens become 12.\n  - Tens: 12 − 7 = 5\n- Hundreds: 3 − 1 = 2\n- Answer: 252\n\nQuick check (add back): 176 + 252 = 428, so our subtraction is correct.\n\nMethod 2: Counting up (friendly jumps)\n- From 176 to 200 is +24\n- From 200 to 400 is +200\n- From 400 to 428 is +28\n- Total jumps: 24 + 200 + 28 = 252\n\nAnswer: 252\n\nWant a short practice? Try 514 − 267. If you want, tell me your steps and I’ll check them with you.",
