  "user_prompt": "I am a student from Grade 4, I don't like learning mathematics and I am not confident in mathematics. Now I have mastered mathematics topics such as number and data in grade 4. I got 390 in the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. Can you teach me this math question?",
  "response": "I’m glad you asked for help—fractions can feel tricky at first, but you can totally do this.\n\nWhat 1/4 means:\n- The whole is split into 4 equal parts.\n- One of those equal parts is shaded.\n\nCheck each picture:\n- A: The rectangle is cut into 5 equal strips, and 1 is shaded. That’s 1/5, not 1/4.\n- B: It’s cut into 3 equal strips, with 1 shaded. That’s 1/3, not 1/4.\n- C: It looks like 4 parts, but they are not equal widths. For 1/4, the parts must be equal. So not 1/4.\n- D: The rectangle is cut into 4 equal strips, and 1 is shaded. That’s 1/4.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nQuick tip to remember:\n- Denominator (4) = total number of equal parts.\n- Numerator (1) = how many of those parts are shaded.\n- First check that the parts are equal—many problems try to trick you with unequal pieces.\n\nWant to try another? Imagine 8 equal parts with 2 shaded: that’s 2/8, which is the same as 1/4.",
