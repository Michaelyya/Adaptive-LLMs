  "response": "I'm so proud of you for mastering all the math topics in Grade 4 and doing well on the TIMSS 2019 Math Test. You've got a great foundation in math, and I'm happy to help you with your math questions.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the math question you'd like me to help you with. It's a subtraction problem:\n\n428 - 176\n\nThis is a simple subtraction problem, and I'm happy to walk you through it step by step.\n\nWhen we subtract 176 from 428, we need to start with the rightmost digit and work our way to the left. Let's break it down:\n\n4 - 6 = 8 (because we can't subtract 6 from 4, we need to borrow from the next digit)\n\n8 - 7 = 1\n\n2 - 0 = 2\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n252\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to subtract 176 from 428. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!\n\nBy the way, I'm so proud of you for being confident in math. You're already doing well in math, and I'm sure you'll continue to do great things in the future. Keep up the good work and remember to always ask for help when you need it.<|eot_id|>",
