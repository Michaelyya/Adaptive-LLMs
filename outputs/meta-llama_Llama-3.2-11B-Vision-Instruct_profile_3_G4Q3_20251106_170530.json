  "response": "I can help you with this math question. The question is about a rectangle and a square. You can solve this question step by step:\n\nStep 1: Identify the shapes in the question. The rectangle has a width of 28 cm and a length of 32 cm. The square has a side length of 36 cm.\n\nStep 2: Find the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = 2 x (Length + Width). \n\nStep 3: Find the perimeter of the square. The formula for the perimeter of a square is: Perimeter = 4 x side length.\n\nStep 4: Compare the perimeters of the rectangle and the square. Which one is longer? The rectangle has a longer perimeter than the square.\n\nStep 5: Write the answer. The perimeter of the rectangle is 104 cm and the perimeter of the square is 144 cm.\n\nThe answer is: The perimeter of the rectangle is 104 cm.<|eot_id|>",
