  "response": "Sure! Let's solve the subtraction problem \\(428 - 176\\) step by step.\n\n1. **Arrange the numbers vertically:**\n\n   ```\n     428\n   - 176\n   ```\n\n2. **Start subtracting from the rightmost digit (the units place):**\n\n   - Subtract 6 from 8: \\(8 - 6 = 2\\)\n\n3. **Move to the tens place:**\n\n   - Subtract 7 from 2. Since 2 is smaller than 7, we need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place. This makes 2 become 12.\n   - Subtract 7 from 12: \\(12 - 7 = 5\\)\n\n4. **Finally, move to the hundreds place:**\n\n   - After borrowing, the 4 becomes 3.\n   - Subtract 1 from 3: \\(3 - 1 = 2\\)\n\n5. **Write down the result:**\n\n   ```\n     428\n   - 176\n   ------\n     252\n   ```\n\nSo, \\(428 - 176 = 252\\).",
